1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an 
opportunity to explain what you would add. 
 
             I've spent all togeather 2 hours from setting up the framework using cucumber jvm and writing tests.

2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation? 

- JavaScript based test automation frameworks such as WebdriverIO , Cypress etc are currently more popular and stable UI test automation frameworks which can handle asyc nature of angularJs , 
  ReactJs applications

- Artificial Intelligence  based  visual validation testing, which uses a sophisticated algorithm to out potential bugs in your application without you explicitly calling out all the elements 
  Currently Applitools have implemented this .
